# Ralph Work Directory

This directory contains all outputs generated by the Ralph autonomous coding loop.

## Structure

- **generated/** - Generated code organized by story/task ID
  - Each story gets its own subdirectory: `generated/{story_id}/`
  - Files are created exactly as specified in the PRD or task description
  
- **test-outputs/** - Outputs from test runs
  - Test results and logs from ralph test suites
  
- **complex-tasks/** - Outputs from complex multi-step tasks
  - Results from sophisticated multi-agent workflows
  
- **.ralph/** - Ralph internal state
  - `progress.json` - Current execution progress
  - Story attempt tracking and iteration history

## Usage

All new files created by Ralph that are not part of the base agentic-framework program are automatically routed here. This keeps the main codebase clean while preserving all generated work.

## Organization

Each project/task gets its own folder structure:
```
ralph-work/
  generated/
    story-001/
      src/
      tests/
      README.md
    story-002/
      ...
```
